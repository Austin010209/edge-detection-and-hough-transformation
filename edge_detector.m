function [temp1] = edge_detector(A,fun)
%It is the implementation of Q2c
%   It detects zero crossings in different directions 

%The convoluted image is
I1 = conv2(A,fun,'same');
%image being shifted right by one unit(we mainly need this)
I2 = circshift(I1,[0 1]);
%this is for the case that there is a zero showing but the two values in
%two sides of 0 is the same size. In this case, there is no zero crossing
I3 = circshift(I1,[0 -1]);
%initialize the binary image for edges
temp1 = zeros(size(I1));
%seeing the possible change in sign

%{
This is initially for avoiding turbulences in dealing with significantly 
small numbers, but I see in discussion that we do not need this, so I 
comment it out. In fact this process will make the edge detection a lot 
better., for example thinner the edge.
I12(I12>-1.0e-18 & I12<1.0e-18)=0;
I23(I23>-1.0e-18 & I23<1.0e-18)=0;

%either there is a zero crossing, or there is a zero present but the values
%on two sides have different sign, we need to make a mark there, to 1.
temp1((I12<0) | (I12==0)&(I23<0))=1;
%However, it may detect some non-exist zero-crossing as well, namely in the
%boundary of the image(in that the one that is shifted out is put in the 
%first column). We do not need them; they are misleading
temp1(:,1) = 0; 




%And then we do the same idea, same thing, only for different directions.
%This time is for shift of rows.
I2 = circshift(I1,[1 0]);

in the same reason as before, this good feature is turned off
I12(I12>-1.0e-18 & I12<1.0e-18)=0;

%If a point is marked as an edge, it should merge with the initial findings
%of edges, so we do or, and keep the first one going.
temp1 = temp2|temp1;



%Since we are detecting edges for rectangles, to detect edge diagonally is
%redundant, since by definition there is no diagonal-like edges. Instead
%detect diagonal edges will thicker the edges.

%This time shift in bottom right direction
I2 = circshift(I1,[1 1]);
I3 = circshift(I1,[-1 -1]);
temp3 = zeros(size(I1));

temp3((I12<0) | (I12==0)&(I23<0))=1;
temp3(1,:) = 0;
temp3(:,1) = 0;
%similarly, we merge results by or
temp1 = temp1|temp3;



%This time for top right direction
I2 = circshift(I1,[1 -1]);
I3 = circshift(I1,[-1 1]);
